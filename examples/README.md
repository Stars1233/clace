# Example Clace Apps

This folder has some sample Clace apps. A demo of these apps is running at [demo.clace.io](https://demo.clace.io/).

- demo is a static page which hosts the links to the other apps.
- disk_usage is an app which uses the `du` CLI to generate disk usage reports, sorted by size.
- memory_usage is an app which uses the `ps` CLI to generate a process memory usage report, grouping processes by their parent process.
- cowbull is a word game, to find a word by submitting guesses. This app depends on another service for data persistence API's.
